Introduction:
At our analytics consulting firm, we have conducted a thorough feasibility analysis for opening an online bookstore platform. Our evaluation was driven by market dynamics and the increasing demand for home delivery services, which was further amplified by the impact of COVID-19. Our objective was to delve into the data and market trends from 2020 to provide valuable insights regarding the potential benefits of establishing an online platform.

Background:
In our analysis, we have carefully examined the current state of the physical bookstore, considering its competitive advantages and market position. However, we have also identified critical gaps in the existing system, necessitating an adaptation to evolving customer preferences. By recognizing the untapped potential in the book delivery sector and the sustained demand for convenient purchasing options, we aim to guide stakeholders towards a compelling investment opportunity.

Project Scope:
Our analysis centers on a comprehensive assessment of the bookstore's financial performance in 2020, with a particular emphasis on home delivery sales. Through meticulous revenue and sales breakdowns, we have revealed a substantial portion of sales stemming from home deliveries. By projecting a remarkable 20% revenue growth upon the establishment of an online platform, we demonstrate the potential for significant returns on investment. This strategic move will enable the bookstore to leverage the power of online ordering, capture an expanded market share, and effectively cater to the evolving needs of its discerning customers.

Methodology:
Our approach is grounded in a rigorous and data-centric methodology. By employing advanced SQL queries for comprehensive sales analysis and conducting targeted customer surveys, we have gained invaluable insights into customer preferences and behaviors. Furthermore, our analysis encompasses thorough cost analysis and extensive market research, ensuring a holistic understanding of the potential benefits and outcomes associated with the establishment of an online bookstore platform.

Through this refined and professional presentation, we effectively communicate the key findings of our feasibility analysis and underscore the strategic advantages of investing in an online bookstore platform.
